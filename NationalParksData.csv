Fixed to these posts are small square signs with campsite numbers ranging from 1-10, arrows pointing in the direction of each site, and a small brown square showing two white silhouettes of gender-neutral hikers with walking sticks and backpacks. The sites themselves are located in the inner dune areas, which are the flat low points between dunes. The ground here is hard-packed, firmer, and often slightly darker than the soft white sand found in the dunes themselves. In some of the sites and along parts of the trail, you can find bushels of varying types of grasses, which tend to be around 1-2 feet tall and dark green and tan in color. There may also be other types of vegetation along the trail and in the campsites, including the soaptree yucca. Depending on the season, the yucca have two main components: their bayonet leaves, which are dark green, about an inch wide, and sharp enough at the tips to warrant their name; and the stem, which is a tall, woody feature that stands vertically from the base and is often over five feet tall. When a stem is present, many creamy white flowers rest on its tip. The flower petals harden after they bloom in late spring, and transform into firm capsules that house the yuccaâs dark brown, round seeds.

Pine rocklands are characterized by tall slash pine trees, with peeling brown bark and high green needles. The ground between the spaced out pine trees is a low lying shrubby mixture of saw palmettos, dense grasses numerous wooded shrubs. Craggy, chalky white limestone characterizes the ground, and can make walking off path difficult. If there has been a fire recently, there can be charred remains of burnt trees and crunch ash on the pineland floor Follow the slowly winding Pinelands road to a forked split to either the campground or a day use area. A slight left will take you to the campground. A white building with a green metallic roof welcomes campers to the Long Pine Key Campground. Behind this entrance station is a small patch of grass containing several garbage receptacles and tall information boards including a map of the campground and interpretive information about fireâs role in the habitat. A red payphone stands next to the information boards. The campground road follows a one-way counter clockwise loop, approximately a mile in length, that is in the shape of an oval. Slash pine trees are the dominant plant species, but a wide variety of small shrubs such as beauty berry and sumac add purple or red to the green foliage. As you follow the road around in a slow arc moving south west, the loop is bisected by alphabetized roads ascending from âAâ to âKâ. Each lettered road has anywhere between 5-7 camping areas. Camping areas include a paved slab for vehicle parking, a mowed lawn area, a circular black metal fire ring with a grill attachment, and a 6 or 8 foot gray picnic table. On alternating lettered roads, the restrooms sit in white buildings with green roofs and have two separate entrances on either side. White cement shower buildings have tall green roofs which are covered by solar panels for water heating. Through the vegetation to the north, there is a large blue human made lake, which surrounds an island with dozens of tall slash pines sitting atop the rocky outcrop. At the loop halfway point lies a small parking area and a paved, lighted walking path leading to an amphitheater. The amphitheater hugs the lakeside shoreline and contains twelve rows of benched seating, bisected by a center aisle. A large white wooden backdrop faces the benches as well as a presentation podium for a speaker. The road begins to circle around the loop and now heads to the northeast. The lettered roads begin to move up from âKâ to âAâ and there are spaced out camp areas on either side. To the south the Pine Rockland habitat extends for over a mile, with the tall slash pines looming over the campground.

The bulletin board contains information on how to select a site, pay, rules, regulations and any current concerns regarding the campground.

This road is now considered a trail for hikers, bicyclists, and pet walking. Across from sites 4 and 5 is a native stone and wood structure. This restroom is closed due to water rights legislation which does not give the National Park Service senior rights to use of the water in Lost Creek and its reservoir. Instead, there are portable toilets, several which are accessible, stationed alongside the building. Beyond the closed restroom, the road continues in a circular fashion with access to sites 6 to 16. The road and all campsite parking are covered with small crushed gravel-like rock. Tent areas are mostly dirt and natural debris with some crushed rock. All sites are generally level with room to park two vehicles. Each site has one picnic table; bases are white and formed from concrete; tops are made of heavy planks of wood.

Travel throughout each loop is one-way in a clockwise direction. At the front of each site is a wooden post with the site number. The sites are dispersed through a forest of lodgepole pines, mountain hemlocks, Shasta red firs, and subalpine firs. Douglas squirrels, gray jays, and Stellerâs jays are commonly seen and heard. Each site contains a brown wooden picnic table, a bear-resistant food locker, and a fire ring with a grill. A paved or gravel parking area is provided for cars or an RV. Trash and recycling receptacles are dispersed throughout each loop. The first left turn from the main campground road goes to A-loop with 15 sites including one accessible site, A10.
